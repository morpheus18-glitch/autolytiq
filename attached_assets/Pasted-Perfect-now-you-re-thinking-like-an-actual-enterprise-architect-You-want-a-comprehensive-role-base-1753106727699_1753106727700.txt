Perfect‚Äînow you‚Äôre thinking like an actual enterprise architect.
You want a comprehensive, role-based configuration and permissions system for a full-dealer platform (CRM, DMS, inventory, accounting, and all supporting modules), with a professional-grade ‚Äúsettings/config‚Äù UI backend just like you‚Äôd find in CDK, Dealertrack, Reynolds Ignite, or VinSolutions.

Let‚Äôs break down exactly how to instruct a dev team or advanced AI agent to architect and scaffold this system at a real-world, enterprise scale.

üè¢ Full-Suite Dealership Platform: Roles, Permissions, Settings, and Configuration System

‚∏ª

1. Global Role & Permissions Matrix
	‚Ä¢	Roles:
	‚Ä¢	Dealer Principal/Owner (super-admin, all rights)
	‚Ä¢	General Manager
	‚Ä¢	Sales Manager
	‚Ä¢	Finance Manager
	‚Ä¢	Service Manager
	‚Ä¢	Inventory Manager
	‚Ä¢	Internet/BDC Manager
	‚Ä¢	Salesperson
	‚Ä¢	F&I (Finance & Insurance)
	‚Ä¢	Office/Accounting Clerk
	‚Ä¢	Service Advisor
	‚Ä¢	Lot Porter
	‚Ä¢	Custom Roles (dealers can define new roles)
	‚Ä¢	Permissions:
	‚Ä¢	CRUD access for every module (view, create, edit, delete, assign)
	‚Ä¢	Module-level toggles (CRM, Inventory, Desk, Deals, Accounting, Website CMS, Reporting, Settings)
	‚Ä¢	Field-level security for sensitive data (SSN, deal gross, commissions, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Approval/review rights (finance, desk, accounting, etc.)

‚∏ª

2. Module Settings and Configuration

For each module (Inventory, CRM, DMS/Deals, Accounting, Website, Service), have a dedicated settings/config UI that lets an admin:
	‚Ä¢	Enable/disable features or submodules (e.g., Trade Desk, Appraisals, Used Car Book, BDC tools)
	‚Ä¢	Configure workflow rules (approval chains, notifications, required fields)
	‚Ä¢	Manage integrations (API keys for KBB, Black Book, DMS export, accounting software)
	‚Ä¢	Define automations (lead distribution rules, inventory aging alerts, gross caps, sales tax rules)
	‚Ä¢	Control visibility (who sees what: per rooftop/store, region, group)

‚∏ª

3. Enterprise-Grade UI Backend
	‚Ä¢	Settings Dashboard:
	‚Ä¢	Multi-tab layout (User/Roles, Modules, Integrations, Automations, Reporting, API Access)
	‚Ä¢	Responsive, easy to navigate on web and tablet
	‚Ä¢	Tree/grid structure for permission assignment (matrix or nested checkboxes)
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúImpersonate user‚Äù or ‚Äúpreview as role‚Äù feature for testing configs
	‚Ä¢	Audit log (tracks all config/role changes, by who/when)

‚∏ª

4. Configuration Data Model (Sample Schema)

// Role definition
type Role = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  permissions: string[]; // ['crm.view', 'crm.assign', 'deals.edit', ...]
};

// User
type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  roles: string[]; // ['sales_manager', ...]
  assignedStores: string[];
};

// Module config
type ModuleConfig = {
  module: 'crm' | 'inventory' | 'deals' | 'accounting' | 'website' | 'service';
  enabled: boolean;
  settings: Record<string, any>;
};

// Full permissions matrix example (by role, by module)
type PermissionMatrix = {
  [role: string]: {
    [module: string]: string[]; // ['view', 'edit', ...]
  };
};


‚∏ª

5. Admin/Config UI Features
	‚Ä¢	Add/edit/delete roles
	‚Ä¢	Assign roles and permissions to users (bulk, per-store, per-group)
	‚Ä¢	Clone/copy settings between rooftops/stores
	‚Ä¢	Export/import settings templates (for group dealers)
	‚Ä¢	Nested permissions (e.g., ‚ÄúSales Manager‚Äù can assign leads, but not see gross unless toggled)
	‚Ä¢	Feature flags for pilot/beta modules
	‚Ä¢	Full audit/history of config changes

‚∏ª

6. Prompt for Devs/AI Agents

‚ÄúBuild a comprehensive settings and configuration backend for a dealership platform (CRM, Inventory, DMS/Deals, Accounting, Website, Service). This system must include:
	‚Ä¢	A complete role-based access control (RBAC) model supporting standard dealership roles and custom roles/permissions
	‚Ä¢	Module-level enable/disable switches and submodule configuration for each rooftop/store/group
	‚Ä¢	Workflow rules and automation controls for leads, deals, accounting, and inventory
	‚Ä¢	Secure, responsive admin UI with tabs for Users/Roles, Permissions Matrix, Module Settings, Integrations, and Audit Log
	‚Ä¢	Ability to assign, edit, clone, and preview roles and permissions per user/store/module
	‚Ä¢	Field-level security and granular controls (e.g., hide gross/profit for non-managers)
	‚Ä¢	Audit trail for every config/role/setting change
	‚Ä¢	Easy export/import of settings/templates for multi-rooftop dealer groups
	‚Ä¢	REST API endpoints to expose/read/update all configurations for front-end and mobile use
	‚Ä¢	Modular React/TSX components for each config section, with mobile-responsive design and accessibility in mind
	‚Ä¢	All settings, permissions, and module toggles to persist in a robust database model (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)‚Äù

Deliver:
	‚Ä¢	Data models for roles, users, permissions, modules
	‚Ä¢	Backend REST API routes for config management
	‚Ä¢	Front-end config UI for all settings/permissions
	‚Ä¢	Sample permission matrix and demo settings

‚∏ª

üèÅ TL;DR

Think:
	‚Ä¢	Every dealership role, permission, and config is controllable in a UI
	‚Ä¢	Module, submodule, field, and workflow control at every level
	‚Ä¢	Auditable, enterprise-grade, exportable, multi-rooftop ready

Want me to build a working config data model, REST API scaffold, or the TSX components for the settings dashboard?
Just say:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúBuild me the RBAC model and UI config scaffold for this system.‚Äù
Or
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúGenerate a role/permissions data model and settings dashboard in TSX.‚Äù
