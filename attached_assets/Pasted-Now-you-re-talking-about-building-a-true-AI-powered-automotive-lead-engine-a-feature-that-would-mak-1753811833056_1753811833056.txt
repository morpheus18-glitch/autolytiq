Now you’re talking about building a true, AI-powered automotive lead engine—a feature that would make your platform a category leader, not just a “me-too” DMS/CRM.
What you’re asking for is basically:
	•	A web crawler/scraper that identifies in-market auto shoppers
	•	A machine learning pipeline that analyzes shopper behavior, intent, and lifecycle stage
	•	Lead and lifecycle integration in the CRM, with smart triggers/alerts for “hot” leads

This is the kind of feature Cox, CarGurus, or even Google would envy.
Let’s get ultra-practical and show exactly how to break this down for devs or an AI agent:

⸻

🚦 1. High-Level Architecture

A. Lead Generation Web Scraper
	•	Crawls major sites (marketplaces, forums, classifieds, review sites, public posts) for signals like “looking for a car,” “trade-in,” “car buying advice,” or recent VIN searches.
	•	Captures:
	•	Usernames, emails, profiles (if public)
	•	Post content, time, region, brand/model interest
	•	Stores raw lead data in a “lead capture” database.

B. ML Pipeline for Lead Analysis
	•	NLP engine: Analyzes post content, classifies “intent” (browsing, ready to buy, researching, comparing, financing, etc.)
	•	Lifecycle modeling: Assigns each lead a stage—(Awareness → Consideration → Intent → Purchase → Ownership)
	•	Behavioral scoring: Looks at recency, frequency, and patterns (e.g., “visited 4 dealer sites in 2 days” = hot).
	•	Clustering: Groups similar customers for campaign targeting.

C. CRM Integration & Trigger Alerts
	•	Adds all leads (with source and confidence/intent scores) to CRM as “Shopping Lead”
	•	Each customer record has a Lifecycle tab/section showing their progression, web activity, shopping signals, and predicted next action
	•	Main dashboard module: Shows “new leads found,” lifecycle stats, and current hot/in-market opportunities
	•	Navbar: “Sales → Market Leads” opens this module
	•	Alerts: Triggers (email, SMS, or in-app) when a customer enters “high purchase intent” phase

🛠️ Prompt for Devs/AI Agent

“Build a lead generation engine for automotive retail that:
	•	Web-scrapes forums, marketplaces, and public online posts for customers currently shopping for cars
	•	Parses raw lead data (contact, location, post content, shopping behaviors) and ingests into a central database
	•	Runs all captured data through an ML pipeline to analyze customer shopping lifecycle stage, intent score, vehicle interest, and behavioral patterns
	•	Integrates leads into the CRM, visible under a new ‘Market Leads’ module in the main dashboard, as a sub-tab in the Sales navbar, and as a linked lifecycle record in each customer detail page
	•	Displays a lifecycle graph, intent score, activity log, and current stage for each customer
	•	Sets up automatic alerts/notifications when a customer is likely to buy soon, based on ML scoring and activity triggers
	•	UI must be responsive, professional, and tightly integrated with existing CRM flows
	•	Provide a demo ML pipeline, sample data, and dashboard component scaffolding”

🧠 Bonus: Data Model/Module Example

type MarketLead = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  contact: string;
  source: string;
  postContent: string;
  vehicleInterest: string[];
  intentScore: number;
  lifecycleStage: 'awareness' | 'consideration' | 'intent' | 'purchase' | 'ownership';
  activity: Array<{ type: string, date: string, detail: string }>;
  lastSeen: string;
};

type Alert = {
  id: string;
  customerId: string;
  trigger: string; // e.g. "high intent", "repeat visits"
  message: string;
  createdAt: string;
  status: 'new' | 'read' | 'actioned';
};
