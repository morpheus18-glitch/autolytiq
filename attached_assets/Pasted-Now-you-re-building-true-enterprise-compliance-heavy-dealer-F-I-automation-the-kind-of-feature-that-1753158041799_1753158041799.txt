Now you‚Äôre building true enterprise, compliance-heavy dealer F&I automation‚Äîthe kind of feature that only the biggest platforms (RouteOne, Dealertrack, Darwin, Reynolds) deliver at scale. Here‚Äôs how to architect and spec it (with a prompt you can give any dev team or AI system):

‚∏ª

üè¶ F&I Section Additions for Customer Tab (with Real Credit/Lender Integration)

1. Credit Pull & Report Viewer
	‚Ä¢	Integrate with a credit bureau gateway (RouteOne, Dealertrack, 700Credit, or a direct Experian/Equifax/TransUnion provider).
	‚Ä¢	Collect required customer consent.
	‚Ä¢	Support real-time credit pulls, show PDF or inline credit report (with compliance redaction for non-authorized users).
	‚Ä¢	Log all pulls for audit (who pulled, when, why, which bureau).
	‚Ä¢	Link report data directly to customer profile (score, flags, tradelines, etc.).

‚∏ª

2. Lender Submission/Approval Workflow
	‚Ä¢	Submit application to one or more lenders (RouteOne, Dealertrack, CUDL, etc.) via their official API.
	‚Ä¢	Select lenders and products to submit to.
	‚Ä¢	Track submission status: Pending, Conditional, Approved, Declined, Stipulations.
	‚Ä¢	On response, map lender approvals back to deal structure (rates, terms, conditions).
	‚Ä¢	Show approval matrix (side-by-side offers, stipulations, reserve, backend product eligibility).
	‚Ä¢	Store all responses for auditing and deal audit trail.

‚∏ª

3. Finance Menu Presentation System
	‚Ä¢	Build a finance menu UI (for F&I manager or salesperson) to present backend products (warranty, GAP, tire/wheel, prepaid maintenance, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Product catalog: Name, cost, retail price, description, eligibility (by lender or deal type).
	‚Ä¢	Interactive selection: Add/remove products, recalculate payment, show total cost, track customer acceptance/decline.
	‚Ä¢	Store menu presentations as part of deal history (printable and auditable).
	‚Ä¢	Support ‚Äúrate-the-product‚Äù (show and select available rates/terms/costs for each product).

‚∏ª

4. Permissions, Security, and Compliance
	‚Ä¢	Only authorized users (F&I, sales managers) can pull/view credit or submit lender apps.
	‚Ä¢	Audit log every action (who, what, when).
	‚Ä¢	Data masking for sensitive fields when viewed by unauthorized roles.

‚∏ª

5. Menu System for Finance Presentations
	‚Ä¢	Menu options for:
	‚Ä¢	Vehicle Service Contract (warranty)
	‚Ä¢	GAP Insurance
	‚Ä¢	Tire & Wheel
	‚Ä¢	Prepaid Maintenance
	‚Ä¢	Theft Protection
	‚Ä¢	Environmental/Appearance
	‚Ä¢	Show cost/retail/margin per product
	‚Ä¢	Display ‚Äúrate card‚Äù and allow payment calculation (with/without products)
	‚Ä¢	Store final menu/acceptance with digital signature or user stamp

üß† Sample Prompt for Dev/AI Agent

	‚Ä¢	Collect and log consent for credit pulls; display credit report inline or as PDF
	‚Ä¢	Submit credit applications to multiple lenders, track status and receive approvals/responses via API

	‚Ä¢	Enforce strict role-based access, audit every action, and mask sensitive fields for non-authorized users
