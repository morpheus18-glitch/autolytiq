## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Development Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Always check `ARCHITECTURE.md` before making changes to prevent code duplication and fragmentation. This document contains the canonical file structure and anti-duplication rules for AI-assisted development.

### AI Development Rules
1. **Check existing files first** - Search for related components before creating new ones
2. **Update canonical files** - Never duplicate core components like `sidebar-manager.tsx`, `dashboard.tsx`, etc.
3. **Extend, don't recreate** - Add features to existing files rather than creating new versions
4. **Maintain imports** - Ensure all references point to the correct canonical files
5. **Test after changes** - Verify functionality works after modifications
