Absolutely. You’re asking for a high-level architecture and UX brief for building a true Showroom Manager Tool—the core of any modern dealership workflow.

This is what real-life tools like DealerSocket, VinSolutions, and Reynolds “Showroom” modules do, but your version should be lean, modern, and deeply integrated with your deal desk and customer management flow.

🚦 How to Explain and Design a Showroom Manager Tool

⸻

1. What is the Showroom Manager?

A central workspace for sales managers to:
	•	View, sort, and manage all active showroom customers and traffic
	•	Instantly pivot to customer details, desk a deal, or see team performance
	•	Create new deals that hand off all data cleanly to finance

⸻

2. Key Functional Requirements

a) Quick Pivot UI
	•	Tabs or sidebar navigation: Customers, Showroom, Desk Tool, Appointments, Inventory
	•	Persistent quick-action bar: “Desk Deal,” “Assign Sales Rep,” “View Activity,” “Send to F&I”

b) Showroom Traffic List
	•	Live dashboard of all customers currently in the showroom (and status: “Arrived,” “In Test Drive,” “Working Numbers,” “In F&I,” “Delivered”)
	•	Filter/sort by salesperson, arrival time, status, hot leads, appointments

c) Integrated Customer Drilldown
	•	Clicking a customer slides open a panel with:
	•	All customer/contact info
	•	Notes and visit history
	•	Vehicles of interest or trade-in info
	•	“Start Deal” button (creates deal and routes to Desk Tool)

d) Smooth Transition to Desk Tool
	•	One-click “Start Deal” launches the Desk Tool, automatically carrying over all customer data, trade-in, credit app, and notes.
	•	Desk Tool allows full deal structuring—then “Send to F&I” routes deal (with unique deal number) to finance module for contract finalization and accounting mapping.

e) Clean, Responsive Layout
	•	Single-screen, no clutter
	•	Side-by-side or tabbed panels for customer list, detail, and current desked deal
	•	Sticky action buttons for rapid workflow

3. UX Flow
	1.	Sales manager logs in → lands on Showroom Manager.
	2.	Sees live list of all customers in showroom with status, salesperson, and “actions” buttons.
	3.	Clicks customer → right panel shows details and “Desk Deal” option.
	4.	Clicks “Desk Deal” → launches deal structuring form, all info pre-filled.
	5.	Completes deal structure → clicks “Send to F&I”.
	6.	Deal is instantly available in Deal Desk/Finance screen for review, print, contracts, and accounting.

⸻

4. Data Flow and Integration
	•	All actions write to a central state/store (Redux, Zustand, or Context API) to ensure smooth handoff (customer → showroom → deal desk → F&I → accounting).
	•	Each customer or deal has a unique ID tying all actions together for perfect traceability.

5. Example Module/File Structure

/components/
  ShowroomManager.tsx
  CustomerList.tsx
  CustomerDetailDrawer.tsx
  DeskDealModal.tsx
  DealDesk.tsx
/store/
  customers.ts
  showroom.ts
  deals.ts
/pages/
  showroom.tsx
  deals/[id].tsx

6. Implementation Prompt for Developers or AI Agent

“Build a Showroom Manager module with:
	•	Live list of active showroom customers (sortable/filterable)
	•	Drilldown drawer for customer info and current status
	•	‘Desk Deal’ button that opens the Desk Tool and pre-fills all relevant data
	•	Full deal structure can be sent to finance (Deal Desk) with all linked customer info, trade, notes, and credit app
	•	Clean, responsive layout with rapid navigation between customer, desk, and F&I tools
	•	All state persists across modules for seamless handoff to finance/accounting”**

⸻

🔥 TL;DR
	•	The Showroom Manager is the live command center for all sales/customer activity.
	•	It pivots instantly to deal creation, and then sends everything to finance with no data loss.
	•	UX must be frictionless, modern, and actionable in one or two clicks max.
